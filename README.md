# PROJECT-PYTHON

I made this project to test some Data Analysis skills i learned on the course, and also get to know Python and itÂ´s efficiency with data manipulation and analysis.

This is a personal project, the dataset can be found on Kaggle at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results).

The reason I decided to study Data Analysis was to get to know more of this area and also learn how to deal with data. During this journey I learned a lot about 
Data Cleaning, Exploration, Integrity and Security, Data Analysis and how to make data-driven decisions. I also got to learn SQL, Python, R and Tableau.
